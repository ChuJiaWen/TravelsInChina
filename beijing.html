						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/beijing/beijing.jpg" alt="Beijing"></span>
						<strong>Beijing</strong> is the capital of the People's Republic of China. It is also an ancient capital with a history of more than 3,000 years. In ancient times, it was called Yanjing and Peiping. With a population of more than 21 million, Beijing is the most densely populated city in China. Therefore, traffic jams are the norm, and public transportation, such as subways and buses, is also unimaginably crowded. However, this does not stop people from all over the country and even the world from coming to Beijing. The reason is that Beijing has its unique advantages and charm, whether it is to travel or to live and work.</p>

							Tsinghua University and Peking University are the two best universities in China. Every Chinese has a life question when they are young: whether to go to Peking University or Tsinghua University. Coincidentally, my junior high school is the High School Affiliated to Tsinghua University, and my senior high school is the High School Affiliated to Peking University.
							<strong>Tsinghua University</strong>, formerly known as Tsinghua Xuetang, was founded in 1911 to promote academic exchanges and cooperation, draw on the strengths of others, and become an important academic center connecting the academic community of China and abroad.
							<strong>Peking University</strong> was founded in 1898 during the Reform, and was originally known as the Capital University. It is the first national comprehensive university in modern China, and also the highest educational administrative organ of the country at the very beginning. Peking University was the center of the New Culture Movement and the origin of the May Fourth Movement. It was the first university to spread Marxism, scientific and democratic ideas in China, and was one of the important bases for the founding of the Communist Party of China.

It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River and is known as <strong>"Nine Provinces' Thoroughfare"</strong>.

								Once the yellow crane left it will never return, for one thousand years the clouds wandered carelessly.<br>
								The clear river reflects each Hanyang tree, fragrant grasses lushly grow on Parrot Island.<br>
								At sunset, which direction leads to my hometown? One could not help feeling melancholy along the misty river.

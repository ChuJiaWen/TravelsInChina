1. Whether you created your own HTML and CSS from scratch or modified a CSS template.
Our website is modified from templates.

2. If you used a CSS template, a link to the original template you chose to modify.
All the templates are from templated.co. Since the website has broken, we cannot provide the links here.
The name of the main template is Retrospect. We also used the Urban's banner for reference. See credits page.

3. A brief description of how you met the Interactive Features requirement using JS toolkits provided by others (e.g. Wufoo form on Contact page and Lightbox on Gallery page)
We used TypeIt for every internal pages' heading, and Lightbox for some of the images of internal pages.
Specifically, the last three images of the Qingdao.html; The images in the "Places to Visit" section of the Wuhan.html; And the images in the "Places to Visit" section of the Beijing.html.

4. A brief description of how you met the Interactive Features requirement using JS coding (or other web programming languages such as python, php, ...) from scratch (e.g. the calculator in the internal page "stock" is made by JS coding from scratch).
In the beginning of the home page, we ask the users to fill in their first name, and it will show "Hello, [first name]" in the banner before "Welcome to China" in order to give a sense of one-one service.
If they fill in blank or click cancel, the sign will be "Hello, friend".
